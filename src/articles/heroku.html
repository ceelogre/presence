For the first time (or in a while), I've been able to create a successful heroku deployment.

Started by adding Mocha

npm i mocha

Add its configuuration to package.json

Then attempted to run test and ran into an issue. I had import assert and I got an error that says can not use import outside of a module. Aftera bit of search I found out that you can just add type: module to your package.json and mocha will not complain. I did this, tests ran, I went on to configure travis ci and codeclimate, just  a blaze add .travis.yml and the likes get the reporter id from cc and it  and boom! my test were passing. I went on to install nyc, give reporter flags and that was easy.

Now I attempted a heroku deploy which was created the right way cause I added a build script to be ran by babel/cli in the deployment phase. This already helps with waiting for the app to build while browsing. Then I was hit with a weird face, after creating a build dir, there were commonjs file which were still being treated as modules according to package.json. What I did? Remove the config and make test file .mjs. Heroku doesn't complain and so is moch.

Deal with type:module and sequelize errors:

0. Create your model and move it out of models dir
1. generate a model
2. Rename the new model to cjs
3. npm run migrate
