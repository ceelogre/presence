Problem: I wanted to create a copy of a reposirty without forking it. 

Approach: I went ahead and cloned the repo on my PC. Second, I created a new repository that I will be pushing to under my github account. The last thing was to point the local project to my remote instead of the original remote. 

I tried a couple of ways

git remote show showed me information about where I'm pushing to.
git remote rename <old_uri> <new_uri> seemed to be the answer I was looking but I was hit with an error that fatal: remote is not available. At that point, I knew that it's probably there to chagne remote names like origin not the actual URI.

After a couple of trial and errors while running through git remote manual, I  eventually came across the command that I was looking for:
git remote set-url --push <name> <new_uri>

There are other options like --delete which would do half of what I was looking for: removing the pointer to the remote uri but I went ahead and created the whole thing in one line. 

Next time I come across this, I'll just lie to myself that I will rememmber how to do it without looking at this article.
