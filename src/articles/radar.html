  <title>Thoughts - Traffic Radar</title>
</head>
<body>
  
  <p>So I was doing some research to understand how traffic radar works, given that they've given me tickets a couple of times, I thought it'd be a good start.</p>
  <p>After a couple of videos, I learned that they are based on the Doppler Effect. The principle states that an moving object's frequency will intensify as it's get closer to a standing object and fades away as it passes by. Ofcourse, a couple of more physcis are involved like the calculation of the speed's object based on the distance travelled by the light.</p>
  <p>The ones that are pretty common have three cylinders, as it turns out, the first one is the laser light which I presume is responsible for sending out the light. The second is the camera which will read the license plate and the third (top) is the flashlight to be used in case of lowlight.</p>
  <p>Also, I've learned they're also able to detect a car that runs the lights, and a few other things still in research like wearing seatbelt, phone usage and tailgating. I was happy to learn all this from a police officer in Dubai where the devices are widely in use.</p>
  <p>I've also learned that the radar is able to detect a car that is in the middle of the road, and the one that is on the side of the road. I'm not sure if this is the case in all countries, but I'm pretty sure it's true in most of them.</p>
  <p>As always, there are ways to circumvent this, one of the widely used method (at least in my country) is radar detection apps based on community. Apps like RadarBot will give you a warning if you're about to pass by a location that is known (to the app) to having a speed trap. In my experience, there are false positives and overall, I find the app distracting to use when I'm driving. There are other options like Laserjam, this will alert you also of possible speed traps so you can slow down but you need to be careful not to stop the device from getting a reading (say by quickly stopping) or else you'll be pulled over the police officer if it's a radar handgun or the app will flag your car for further investigation. t</p>
  <p>Overall, I'm happy to learn something new, for example, I didn't know the device can still identify your car even when it's blocked by anther car ahead.</p>
