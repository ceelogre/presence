  <p>I saw a tweet about the central bank putting bonds on sale and it got me thinking how these things work exactly. I went to a broker to find out more, and I'm happy to share this with you.</p>
  <p>Everything here is in the context of Rwanda Stock Exchange, which could be different else where.</p>
  <p>There are two types of commodities that can be bought: bonds and shares. Bonds are non-flactuating and often offered by the central bank while shares are as you might guess, small parts that denote a certain holding in a given company.</p>
  <p>When a company/CB wants to get money, they will put part of their assets on the primary market. A given timeframe will be given (usually less than a month) when these should be sold. Buyers will often buy them at a fixed rate and usually low price. After this period, shares will be listed again on the secondary market which is usually regulated by the Stock Exchange agency. This is where the price of a share will be determined by the demand/supply so if there are many sellers, price per share will drop will and vice versa. As you may guess, companies may not follow the day-to-day operations of the price changes since they already have their money. Think of this as retailer who ships electronics from China. As soon as they get them to the hometown and sell them to the local dealer, they don't really need to care how the dealer is gonna sell it to the consumer.</p>
  <p>So how do you make money? By buying and selling shares of a stock primarily and through dividends offered on a recurring basis. This means that if you own shares in MTN, after working out their financial year and finding out how much they've made, they can decide (it is up to their discretion) to share the interest with shareholders. The typical value for a share can start from 5 rwf to any where 15 and upwards. At this point, it is clear that the bigger your volume, the more return on investment.</p>
  <p>There are a few things to consider if you wanna buy shares/bonds. One of them is are you looking long-term, risk free investment? If so you might want to consider bonds. On the other hand, if you are an entrepreneur willing to bet your money and get a higher return on investment if it succeeds, then go for shares since the demand/supply will determine the ultimate price of the share.</p>
  <p>A couple of caveats to this: price per share have a range so if you're selling, you have to set a price within the limits</p>
  <p>There are certain things I'm not qualified to discuss for example, what's the best time to buy or sell? Many factors will be put into consideration but the golden advice would be talking to a broker.</p>
