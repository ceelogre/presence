            <p>Ofcourse there is that sunday when you don't feel like doing anything but cooking your favorite meal and sinking in the sofa, eyes straight to the wall.</p>
            <p>I'm a fan of horror, it's probably my top genre along with psychological thrillers, action and comedy.(you wanna ruin my day, suggest romance)</p>
            <p>I have enjoyed watching a few franchises in the line of horrors and these quite stood out.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Texas Chain massacres: This has given me quite the gory satisfaction that I crave</li>
                <li>The Purge: I watched forever purge before learning that there are a couple others, probably because everything was self-explanatory but then one day I decided to give the rest of the installments a try. I was not disappointed as it kept me off the edge of the sofa for most of the time. Particularly, The Purge Arnachy stood out due to the fact that it's multi-faceted. There is the seemingly main protagonist who is roaming the streets on purge night, there is a couple that got into trouble, and there is a family in an apartment that is trying hard to stay out of trouble. How they all end up in the same car is an interesting plot by the script writer.</li>
