I had to start mongod with replicaset on instead of using a service to be able to save data using paymatic js
Wow! It creates a new speed database different from the one I already had.
git rebase 101: I was on contact-image branch. The branch had much of the commits from master except one commit. I opened a PR for this but the team did not merge it immediately yet I wanted to start using the latest code right away. Instead of branching from this branch, I branched off from master (which had all but one commits from contact-image) started doing my work, then when they approved the PR  rebased my work off master.

By doing node_env='dev', the value isn't available in the app but when you do export node_env = 'dev', it's available.

Indeed, getting geo location on http might have been disabled in Chrome.

Getting ready for work? I mean writing scripts for frequent tasks.
My first one is pushing a small change. Noticed it's a problem when trying to build a docker image with Jenkins. The configs were messed up so we kept making incremental changes until it was annoying. Wrote a script to add the changed file, commit it and push it. So far doesn't handle credentials caching so in case I mistype it, I've broken the flow. Worth a dime though!

Adding CC
1. Get a key for the repo
2.  Add it to CircleCI
3. Add configs vars to config.yml
4. Add nyc
5. Run nyc locally to produce the inital report

Changing the SSL to full from flexible renders my site unreachable.

Git reflog is a life saver.

I did a git rebase -i HEAD~3

pick sha.. (oldest)
pick sha...
pick sha... (newest)

So, what I did was pick the oldest, that means after I finished rebasing, I had lost all of my recent work.

How did I solve it?

Git reflog,
Find the HEAD where I was previously,
Git reset HEAD~[commit number]

After this, my work was staged so, I discarded the changes and interestingly, I went back to the rebase process where I was first!

That means I had to git rebase --abort and come back to the initial stage before I attempted squashing.
