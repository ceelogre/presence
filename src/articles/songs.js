            <p>Here are my top songs as per artists:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Chainsmokers: Last day alive. It's a bit hard to choose my favorite song from this duo cause they have a lot of great songs but the choice is also easy at the same time. Not a single song has topped this for me so far. New songs like See you again makea great impression but this is still top of the line</li>
                <li>
                    Nicki Minaj: Barbie Dreams. This one might not be the best to vibe to but when it comes to content, hands down! Lines like &quote; Drake worth a hundred milli buyin me shit, but I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin and shit &quote;
                    "Had to cancel Dj Khaled we ain't speakin, ain't no fat nigga tellin me what he aint eatin" and their double entendres easily make it stand out. That being said, Nicki's bars are undisputedly some of the best everywhere. Remember
                    &quote;My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on ducktape &quote;
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
